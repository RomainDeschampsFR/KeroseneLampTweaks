![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3764279-6ef7-43d4-94e9-362c06c7af17)
Mod for The Long Dark to modify the rates of fuel consumption for kerosene lamps, add decay and change the color they emit.
+ To add a few gameplay choices and a little incentive to repair lanterns, the mod offers a few settings to make lanterns in poor condition less efficient in terms of fuel consumption.

## SETTINGS
### Decay
+ **Decay when turning the lantern on**: Add a small condition loss when you switch the lantern on .
+ **Decay over time while on (per hour)**: Add a small condition loss overtime while the lantern is ON.
### Burn rate
+ **Rate of burn for placed lamps**: Modifier for the rate of consumption when the lamp is placed. 0 is no consumption, 1 is game default, 2 is double the consumption.
+ **Rate of burn for held lamps**: Modifier for the rate of consumption when the lamp is held/equipped. 0 is no consumption, 1 is game default, 2 is double the consumption.
### Burn rate penalty
+ **Condition threshold**: There won't be any fuel consumption penalty for a lantern above this condition threshold.
+ **Max penalty**: Maximum fuel consumption penalty when lantern condition is (close to) 0%..
*The penalty increases linearly between the condition threshold (no penalty) and 0% condition (full penalty).*
### Color & audio
+ **Lamp Light Range Modifier**: Multiplier for how far the light from lamps is cast. 
+ **Lamp Light Color**: Color for the lamp light. You can choose a preset, o select custom and choose your own color.
+ **Mute lamps audio**: This enables lamps to be silent when turned on and placed in the game.
